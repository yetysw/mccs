# Upgrade mccs

At the end you run the latest code with your settings unchanged.

```bash
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
```

Your settings live in `.env`, which is not touched. Nothing is stored by the application, so there is no data to migrate.

Before 1.0, variable names and endpoints can still change between versions. Read the release notes on the [releases page](https://github.com/yetysw/mccs/releases) before upgrading.

To go back, check out the previous tag or commit and rebuild.

!!! note
    The default image and container name changed from `mail-setup` to `mccs`. If you relied on the old container name in scripts, set `CONTAINER_NAME` and `IMAGE_NAME` in `.env`.
